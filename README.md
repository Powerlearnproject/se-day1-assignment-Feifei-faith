#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer sscience used for developing,testing and maintaining software.
Reliability in that it ensures software functions as expected without bias.
security-implement protectio practices such as authentication and encryption to secure users information
helps in building the digital world using applications ike web services and websites 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity
mastering process

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning-identify software requirement or purpose
requirement analysis-identify the final user specification
design-building the framework
coding-converting the software into code
testing-checking out if there are bugs or glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology
-linear and sequential
-low flexibility since customer feedback comes back late
-sustable for well defined projects eg in regulated industries
agile methodology
-project is usually broken down to small and manageable bits
-there is flexible requirement
-decentralized control
-there is customer collaboration
-suitable for projects with high degree of uncertainity

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-software developer-
develops applications,programs and systems using programming languages
makes sure software is functional and updates it
reports work to project manager to update on the project

quality assurance engineer 
collaborates with stake holders to understand and clarify software requirement
creates development standards for developers o follow
analyses the product to identify for bugs and suggest changes to ensure efficiency
develops and executes automation scripts using open source tools

project manager
leads the team
discusses the project requirement with the clients and the developers 
creates the projects blueprint
tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone
delivers complete software to the client

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications giving space to code,debug,and sometimes add value adding tools.Such is like Visual Studio Code
helps in editing the source code
makes a code more redeable and give feedbacks about accidental syntax errrors
can make suggestions on a code as a developer types
compiles code fromhuamn readble to machine readable

A VCS manages changes to source code over time eg Git
enables developers to work on the same code base without conflicts
keeps tracks on records allowing easy analysis of each modification

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technological advancement-using agile methods to adapt to emerging trends
Time constraints-adopt agile methodologies
Changing software requirements-adopt agile methodologies
software security-research on ways to prevent hacking and phishing
Software usability and accessibility-empasize on reliability

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit tests
Tests individual methods and functions of the classes.This ensures that each unit functions correctly.
System testing 
Focuses on the whole software including all functionalities and interactions.This verifies the systems functionality and interactions.
integration testing 
Used to verify that different modules and interfaces work well together.This ensures data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
Acceptance testing
Formal tests that verify if a system meets the business requirements.This verifie if the software is user friendly.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to geenrate desired outputs.
Ensures that the user gets the required results.
It gives developers more control over users interactions with AI


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Explain the effects of war-vague
Explain the effects of world war 1 and 2 on the economy and the political world.
It is more specific since it has narrowed down on the specific wars and the exacts aspects that effects the user wants to be noted.
